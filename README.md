- **Smart Home Notifications:** Display alerts or status updates from Home Assistant or other automation platforms.
- **Information Displays:** Show time, weather, or custom messages in offices, shops, or at events.
- **Creative Projects:** Add eye-catching text and animations to art installations, cosplay, or DIY electronics.

## Overview

The **RGB Message Block** is a modular, chainable 5x7 RGB LED sign based on WS2812 LEDs. Each block displays four characters (20 LEDs wide, 7 LEDs tall) and measures just 60x24mm, making it perfect for compact, customizable displays. Multiple blocks can be connected together to create longer messages or larger displays.

## Features

- **Scrolling Text:** The firmware displays scrolling messages across the LED matrix, supporting smooth transitions and effects.
- **Animated Transitions:** Enjoy visually appealing transitions between messages, including fades and color effects.
- **Modular Design:** Each block supports four characters. Chain multiple blocks to expand your display.
- **Home Assistant Integration:** Use the RGB Message Block for notifications, alerts, or status displays in your smart home setup.
- **Custom Animations:** The firmware includes built-in animations and color effects for creative displays.
- **Compact Size:** Each module is only 60x24mm, making it easy to fit into various projects.

## Firmware Description

The provided firmware is designed to:

- Drive the WS2812 LED matrix in a 5x7 layout per character.
